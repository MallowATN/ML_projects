INTC|Chip stocks are staging a big rally (SOXX +3.5%) thanks to Intel's (INTC +3.7%) better-than-feared Q2 report and guidance. Deutsche and Credit Suisse think Intel is setting the bar low for 2H12, and UBS expects rising server CPU and ultrabook sales to keep margins healthy. However, other firms express worries about macro conditions, a strong dollar, and slowing emerging markets growth.

TSLA|Maxim defends Tesla Motors (TSLA -1.5%) after it comes under attack from Wunderlich, saying channel checks indicate a rise in Model S reservations - a data point it considers more important than production delays. The back-and-forth banter on Tesla could continue for a while as the automaker just now starts to tiptoe into mainstream markets and hard numbers are still a ways off.|2012-07-18|-0.1048300826819258|2.1433329582214355|0.2027777777777778|1|0.231
TSLA|Shares of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) take another leg down, now off 6.6% premarket, on a harsh downgrade from Wunderlich. The rationale for the cut from the investment firm is that Street estimates for Tesla factor in production run of 1K vehicles for Q3 and 5K for the year, but the actual production run will likely be lower as issues crop up.|2012-07-18|-0.1048300826819258|2.1433329582214355|-0.11111111111111112|0|0.5882
AMD|More on AMD's Q2: Results largely in-line with lowered guidance. The chipmaker expects Q3 growth of -4% to +2% Q/Q, below Street expectations of +6%, and Intel's guidance for 2%-10% growth. CPU division sales -13% Q/Q, primarily due to a lower ASP. Graphics division -5% with a flat ASP. Gross margin was flat Q/Q at 46%, expected to fall to 44% in Q3. Inventories rose $248M Q/Q to $833M due to lower sales. AMD -3.1% AH. (PR) (CFO comments - PDF)|2012-07-19|-0.1337154523480321|4.860000133514404|0.10158730158730157|0|-0.5149

JPM|Technicians call it filling the gap, but whatever it is, it's not pretty. JPMorgan (JPM -1.8%) gives up just about all of a 6% surge following its earnings report last Friday.

GOOG|Google (GOOG +2.9%) is rallying ahead of this afternoon's Q2 report - eBay's results could be helping, given much of Google's search ad revenue is tied to e-commerce activity. Search ad prices will be in focus, following two quarters of significant declines. Two wild cards that could work in Google's favor: mobile queries are soaring, and ad clicks are surging as a % of total search clicks, thanks to Google's efforts to promote them. Some are worried about Euro and forex exposure. (previous)|2012-07-19|0.0581131439821789|14.77113437652588|0.10119047619047619|1|0.9252
AMD|AMD (AMD -11.9%) crashes to levels last seen in '09 after the Q3 guidance accompanying its Q2 report stokes the fears of weak PC demand and share losses that arose following the chipmaker's July 9 warning. Wedbush is downgrading shares to Neutral, arguing AMD is suffering from notebook CPU share losses, weak desktop channel demand, an inventory build-up, and slow uptake for Bulldozer server CPUs, which compete with Intel's Romley.

GOOG|Unlike Microsoft, Google (GOOG +3.1%) is holding onto its post-earnings gains. The Street is taking heart in strong Y/Y paid click growth and a halt to recent ad price declines. However, some are still worried ad prices remain well below year-ago levels, and wish Google provided details about Motorola's full-quarter performance. Deutsche sees rising mobile ad prices and higher shopping-related mobile search activity giving Google a 2H lift.

Overall same-store sales are running at a growth rate of 9.7%. The uptick in sales is being taken by investors as a positive sign that the company may be taking market share from traditional grocery competitors like Safeway (NYSE:SWY) and Supervalu (NYSE:SVU), who've been struggling with declines in sales volume.

AAPL|Beaten-down chip stocks are rallying (SOXX +2.9%) thanks to pleasing reports from Broadcom, STMicroelectronics, Altera, and others. Interestingly, many Apple (AAPL -4%) suppliers, off initially on the FQ3 miss, are also gaining - even Cirrus Logic (CRUS +3.5%), which has 60%+ exposure. Two possible implications: the Street thinks Samsung will make up for any iShortfall, and/or it's less bothered by Apple's iPhone shipments per se than its margin and ASP declines.

AMZN|Amazon (AMZN -1.9%), which has strongly outperformed the Nasdaq in 2012, is selling off ahead of tomorrow's Q2 report. Amazon's Euro exposure is on the minds of many, as are Kindle sales and the impact of U.S. sales tax collections. Citi (Buy) thinks investors should focus on Amazon's potential to double its share of U.S. online retail over the next decade. Nomura expects Amazon to report another quarter of margin improvements, as it reaps the benefits of huge warehouse investments.|2012-07-25|-0.0263597873333861|10.852499961853027|0.22222222222222224|1|0.9022

Also, Brightcove announces it's acquiring Zencoder, provider of an online video encoding service, for $30M.

AMZN|Amazon (AMZN +5.4%) is now up strongly post-earnings, as worries about top-line weakness and aggressive spending get overshadowed by a rising gross margin. Growing sales of e-books, AWS server/storage capacity, and third-party merchandise (now 40% of unit sales) are contributing to the margin gains. Goldman thinks these trends will lead to Amazon's operating margin bottoming later this year, and reaching 3.7% in 2013. Nomura (previous) also forecasts rising margins.

Though Tilson admits to ""trimming"" his position during Netflix's run-up, he still considers it undervalued relative to other media providers - ""They're trading at $400 per subscriber in a world of $1,000 per sub"" - and argues its scale gives it a big edge - ""Who else is going to spend $3 billion a year for streaming content?"" Of course, many of the firms valued at $1,000/sub are getting a lot more than $8/month.

AMD|"AMD +4.6% after Barron's praises the chipmaker, arguing its SeaMicro server platform unit will help grow its share of an x86 server market where 96% of all hardware uses Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs (per IDC). SeaMicro, acquired in 2012, has developed innovative tech (.pdf) for linking hundreds of CPUs in a dense, low-power fabric that's well-suited for the ""hyperscale"" architectures embraced by Web/cloud firms, among others. The unit uses both AMD Opteron and Intel Atom CPUs, will eventually support ARM-based chips, and wants to license its tech to server OEMs. SeaMicro says it convinced Intel to supply it with Atom CPUs instead of costlier Xeon parts by arguing it ""would sell [4x] as many Atom chips as Xeon chips, and that Intel would make [1.7x] the revenue as they would have with Xeon."""|2013-06-17|0.035263705408371|4.050000190734863|0.325|1|0.8949
