<h1> ETH Basic Prediction Bot </h1>
<div class = "Summary">
    <h4> The main goal of this project is to show the basic element of prediction using ETH dataset webscraped from CoinMarketCap. The idea behind this project is to find some useful features from professional traders and apply it using Machine Learning. </h4>

    <h4> Below is the result of selectKbest to find which features are highly correlated with the closing column (Target Variable).

    <h4> Note that this does not cover the whole features that needs to be feature engineered, I only applied the basic principles of Machine Learning for my own knowledge. If you want to learn more about feature implimentation, you can search on investopedia and create the custom features, much like how I've set some of them up in one of my notebooks.
