<h2> Hello, my name is Tony. Welcome to my repository! These are my projects that I've mostly done over the period of 4 years, relating to Machine Learning.</h2> 
<h4> Majority of these ML topics were self taught, I had a little under 4 years of working experience in Data Science relating to ML application. If there's any advice you
think I can improve on, it would certainly help me become better at trying for an AI engineer title that I've always wished to have! <br><br>
Thanks!<br>
