<h2> Hello, my name is Tony. Welcome to my repository! These are my projects that I've mostly done over the period of 4 years, relating to Machine Learning.</h2> 
<h5> Majority of these ML topics were self taught, I had a little under 4 years of working experience in Data Science relating to ML application. I definitely would like some proper guidance in this field, as there is always room for improvement and I'm trying to catch the latest ML trend after working on some projects. I'm currently working on my crypto automation bot using Reinforcement Learning, but at the same time reformatting my github structure and adding unittest in current/future projects. After finishing the automation AI, I plan to explore a bit more into Computer Vision using Pytorch that I've worked on for a couple of months. If there's any advice you think I can improve on, it would certainly help me become better at trying for an AI engineer title that I've always wished to have! <br><br>
Thanks!<br>
